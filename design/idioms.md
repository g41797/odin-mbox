## loop_mbox and nbio_mbox

- `loop_mbox` = loop + any wakeup (semaphore, custom, or anything)
- `nbio_mbox` = loop + nbio wakeup (a special case of `loop_mbox`)

`nbio_mbox.init_nbio_mbox` creates a `loop_mbox.Mbox` with an nbio-specific `WakeUper`.
All `loop_mbox` procs work on the returned pointer: `send`, `try_receive_batch`, `close`, `destroy`.

## Idiom details

### Idiom 1: Maybe as container — `maybe-container`

**Problem**: You have a `^T` from `new` or `pool.get`. You want to pass it to `send` or `push` safely.

**Fix**: Wrap it in `Maybe(^T)` before any ownership-transferring call.

```odin
// [itc: maybe-container]
m: Maybe(^Msg) = new(Msg)
mbox.send(&mb, &m)
// m is nil here — the mailbox owns the pointer
```

Why: The `send`/`push`/`put` APIs take `^Maybe(^T)`. On success, they set the inner pointer to nil. This prevents use-after-send. On failure (closed), inner is left unchanged — the caller still owns it.

---

### Idiom 2: defer with pool.put — `defer-put`

**Problem**: You get a message from the pool. You want to return it in all paths, including error paths.

**Fix**: Use `defer pool.put` right after getting the message.

```odin
msg, status := pool.get(&p)
m: Maybe(^Msg) = msg
defer pool.put(&p, &m)  // [itc: defer-put]
// ...
mbox.send(&mb, &m)
// if send succeeded: m is nil, defer put is a no-op
// if send failed: m is non-nil, defer put returns it to pool
```

Why: `pool.put` with nil inner is a no-op. So using defer is safe whether or not send succeeded.

---

### Idiom 3: dispose signature contract — `dispose-contract`

**Problem**: You have a struct with internal heap resources. You need a proc to free them all.

**Fix**: Write a dispose proc that follows the `^Maybe(^T)` contract.

```odin
// [itc: dispose-contract]
disposable_dispose :: proc(msg: ^Maybe(^DisposableMsg)) {
    if msg^ == nil {return}
    ptr := (msg^).?
    if ptr.name != "" {
        delete(ptr.name, ptr.allocator)
    }
    free(ptr, ptr.allocator)
    msg^ = nil
}
```

Contract:
- Takes `^Maybe(^T)`.
- Nil inner is a no-op.
- Sets inner to nil on return.
- Frees all internal resources before freeing the struct itself.
- Must be safe to call after a partial init. All cleanup steps handle zero-initialized fields.
- Do not add an error parameter to handle partial init — make the proc defensive.

---

### Idiom 4: defer with dispose — `defer-dispose`

**Problem**: You fill a message with internal heap resources, then send it. If send fails, you need to clean up.

**Fix**: Use `defer dispose(&m)` right after filling the message.

```odin
m: Maybe(^DisposableMsg) = msg
defer disposable_dispose(&m)  // [itc: defer-dispose]

m.?.name = strings.clone("hello", m.?.allocator)
if mbox.send(&mb, &m) {
    result = true
}
// if send succeeded: m is nil, defer dispose is a no-op
// if send failed: m is non-nil, defer dispose frees everything
```

Why: `dispose` with nil inner is a no-op. So using defer is safe whether or not send succeeded.

Same pattern applies to heap-masters — register `defer dispose(&m_opt)` right after successful init. Thread joins run inline before the proc returns, so before the defer fires. Safe.

---

### Idiom 5: DisposableMsg full lifecycle — `disposable-msg`

**Problem**: Messages with internal heap resources need careful handling through pool + mailbox.

**Fix**: Use pool.get, fill, send, receive, pool.put with reset, and a separate dispose for permanent cleanup.

```odin
// Producer:
msg, _ := pool.get(&p)
msg.name = strings.clone("hello", msg.allocator)
m: Maybe(^DisposableMsg) = msg
defer disposable_dispose(&m)          // [itc: disposable-msg]
mbox.send(&mb, &m)

// Consumer:
got, _ := mbox.wait_receive(&mb)
_ = got.name                          // use
m2: Maybe(^DisposableMsg) = got
pool.put(&p, &m2)                     // reset clears name automatically
```

reset does NOT free internal resources. It only clears pointers/strings so the recycled slot is clean.
dispose frees internal resources AND the struct itself.

---

### Idiom 6: foreign message with resources — `foreign-dispose`

**Problem**: `pool.put` returns a non-nil pointer when the message is foreign (its allocator does not match the pool). If the foreign message has internal heap resources, `free` alone is not enough.

**Fix**: Call dispose on the returned pointer, not free.

```odin
ptr, recycled := pool.put(&p, &m)
if !recycled && ptr != nil {
    // foreign message — has internal resources
    foreign_opt: Maybe(^DisposableMsg) = ptr
    disposable_dispose(&foreign_opt)  // [itc: foreign-dispose]
}
```

Why: `free(ptr)` only frees the struct. Internal resources (strings, nested heap data) would leak.

---

### Idiom 7: reset vs dispose — `reset-vs-dispose`

**Problem**: It is easy to confuse reset (for reuse) with dispose (for permanent cleanup).

**Fix**: Keep them separate. Never free internal resources in reset.

```odin
// reset: clears state for reuse. Does NOT free internal resources.
// [itc: reset-vs-dispose]
disposable_reset :: proc(msg: ^DisposableMsg, _: pool.Pool_Event) {
    msg.name = ""   // clear the pointer — do NOT call delete here
}

// dispose: frees everything. Call when the message will not be reused.
disposable_dispose :: proc(msg: ^Maybe(^DisposableMsg)) {
    if msg^ == nil {return}
    ptr := (msg^).?
    if ptr.name != "" { delete(ptr.name, ptr.allocator) }
    free(ptr, ptr.allocator)
    msg^ = nil
}
```

Rule: If the message goes back to the pool, reset runs automatically. If it leaves forever, call dispose.

---

### Idiom 8: dispose is advice — `dispose-optional`

**Problem**: The pool and mailbox do not call dispose. Only the caller does. It is easy to forget.

**Fix**: Know when to call dispose. Use defer (Idiom 4) to make it automatic.

```odin
// pool.put calls reset automatically
// mailbox never calls anything on the message
// YOU call dispose when the message will not be recycled  // [itc: dispose-optional]
```

Cases where dispose is needed:
- Error path: send failed, message not in mailbox, must clean up before return.
- Final drain: after `mbox.close`, all returned messages need dispose if they have internal resources.
- Foreign message from `pool.put`: allocator does not match, pool will not free it.

Cases where dispose is NOT needed:
- Message returned to pool via `pool.put` with matching allocator — pool frees it on `destroy`.
- Message successfully sent — receiver is responsible.

---

### Idiom 9: ITC participants in a heap-allocated struct — `heap-master`

**Problem**: `m: Master` stack-allocated in a proc. `&m.pool`, `&m.inbox` passed to threads. If proc returns before threads finish, the stack frame may be freed while threads still hold pointers.

**Fix**: `m := new(Master)` — heap-allocate. Add a dispose proc following the `^Maybe(^T)` contract. Call dispose after joining all threads.

```odin
m := new(Master) // [itc: heap-master]
if !master_init(m) {
    free(m)
    return false
}
// ... spawn threads passing m ...
// ... join threads ...
m_opt: Maybe(^Master) = m
master_dispose(&m_opt)
```

Tag: `// [itc: heap-master]` at the `new(Master)` line and at the dispose call.

---

### Idiom 10: thread is just a container for its master — `thread-container`

**Problem**: Thread proc declares ITC participants as stack locals (e.g. `my_inbox: mbox.Mailbox(T)`) and stores their address in messages. The thread proc is stateful. Pointers to stack locals escape the thread's frame.

**Fix**: Move all ITC participants into the master struct. Thread proc only casts `rawptr` to `^Master` and calls master logic. The thread owns nothing.

```odin
proc(data: rawptr) {
    c := (^Master)(data) // [itc: thread-container]
    // use c.inbox, c.pool, c.sema — no stack-local ITC participants
}
```

Tag: `// [itc: thread-container]` at the rawptr cast in each thread proc.

---

### Idiom 11: errdefer-dispose — `errdefer-dispose`

**Problem**: A factory proc creates a heap-master and returns it. If any setup step after init fails, the master must be cleaned up before returning an error. Duplicating dispose calls at each error exit is error-prone.

**Fix**: Use a named return `ok` and `defer if !ok { dispose(...) }`.

Two forms side by side:

**Form A — always-dispose** (procs that own the master start to finish):

```odin
// [itc: defer-dispose]
m_opt: Maybe(^Master) = m
defer master_dispose(&m_opt)   // unconditional — fires on all exits
```

**Form B — errdefer** (factory procs that return the master to the caller):

```odin
// [itc: errdefer-dispose]
create_master :: proc() -> (m: ^Master, ok: bool) {
    raw := new(Master)
    if !master_init(raw) { free(raw); return }  // ok=false (zero value)
    m_opt: Maybe(^Master) = raw
    defer if !ok { master_dispose(&m_opt) }     // checks named return ok at exit time

    // ... more setup that might fail ...

    m = raw
    ok = true   // success — defer is no-op; caller owns m
    return
}
```

Key: `defer if !ok` checks the named return variable at exit time, not at registration time. On error, any registered errdefer-dispose fires in LIFO order. On success the condition is false — no-op. No separate flag variable needed — the named return is the flag.

Three cases:
- Init failure: `free(raw)`, bare `return` — dispose not called (partially initialized fields are not safe to shut down).
- Post-init failure: `ok` remains false at exit → `defer if !ok { dispose }` fires.
- Success: `ok=true` at exit → defer is a no-op; caller owns the master.

#### 2. Safety Compliance Summary
This table tracks the project's adherence to core safety invariants.

| Category | Invariant | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ownership** | All ownership-transferring calls (`send`, `put`, `push`) use `^Maybe(^T)`. | **100% Verified** |
| **Stack Safety** | No ITC participants (`Mailbox`, `Pool`, `Queue`) are shared via thread stack. | **100% Verified** |
| **Cleanup** | Every `new` has a corresponding `free` or `dispose` call in all paths. | **100% Verified** |
| **Pool Hygiene** | `pool.put` return values are checked for foreign allocators. | **100% Verified** |
| **Factory Safety** | Complex initialization uses `errdefer-dispose` to prevent partial leaks. | **Verified** |

#### 3. Audit Highlights
*   **Consistency:** All 10 simple examples were refactored to use **Idiom 9 (Heap Master)**. Even "bare-bones" conceptual code now models production-safe thread affinity.
*   **Robustness:** Fixed "silent leaks" in pool examples. Every `pool.put` now explicitly handles the `accepted == false` case for foreign messages.
*   **New reference:** `foreign_dispose.odin` was added specifically to showcase the complex interaction between pools and messages with internal resources.
