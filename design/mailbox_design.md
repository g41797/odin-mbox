# Mailbox Design

## Overview

Two mailbox types. They solve different problems.

- `Mailbox($T)` — for worker threads. Blocks using a condition variable.
- `Loop_Mailbox($T)` — for nbio event loops. Non-blocking. Wakes the loop with `nbio.wake_up`.

## Comparison with `core:sync/chan`

Odin provides `core:sync/chan` for Go-style typed channels. `mbox` is a companion for specific technical needs.

| Feature | `core:sync/chan` | `mbox` |
|---|---|---|
| Allocation per message | yes — copies the value | zero — intrusive link |
| nbio integration | no | yes — `Loop_Mailbox` |
| Receive timeout | no | yes |
| Interrupt without close | no | yes — `interrupt()` (one-time signal) |
| Message ownership | channel owns the copy | caller owns memory; mailbox owns reference while queued |

---

## Internal storage

Both types use `core:container/intrusive/list` internally.

### What intrusive means

A normal list allocates a wrapper node for each item:

```odin
// The list allocates one of these per item (behind the scenes):
List_Node :: struct {
    next: ^List_Node,
    data: ^My_Msg,   // pointer to your data — two objects per message
}
```

An intrusive list does not allocate anything. The link lives inside your struct:

```odin
My_Msg :: struct {
    node: list.Node, // the link IS your struct — one object, zero allocation
    data: int,
}
```

- Zero allocations per message.
- You own the memory.
- Your struct must stay alive while it is in the list.

User struct contract:
- Must have a field named `node`.
- Type of `node` must be `list.Node` from `core:container/intrusive/list`.
- Field name is fixed. Not configurable.

```odin
import list "core:container/intrusive/list"

My_Msg :: struct {
    node: list.Node,  // required
    data: int,
}
```

The `where` clause on all procs enforces this at compile time:

```odin
where intrinsics.type_has_field(T, "node"),
      intrinsics.type_field_type(T, "node") == list.Node
```

If the struct does not have the right `node` field, the compiler gives an error.

### One place only

A `list.Node` can only be in one list at a time.
Do not send a message that is already queued somewhere else.
If the message is in another intrusive structure, call `list.remove` first.

While a message is in the mailbox, the mailbox owns the reference (the link).
When `close()` returns, the reference is handed back to the caller via the returned `list.List`.

## `Mailbox($T)` — worker thread mailbox

### Roles
- Sender: any thread.
- Receiver: worker thread or client thread.

### Behavior
- Many threads can send.
- One or many threads can receive.
- If empty, the receiver thread sleeps. The OS wakes it when a message arrives.
- Uses zero CPU while blocking.

### API
- `send(msg)` — adds message, signals one waiter.
- `wait_receive(timeout)` — blocks until message arrives, timeout, or interrupt. Use `timeout=0` for non-blocking poll.
- `interrupt()` — sends a one-time signal to wake one waiter with `.Interrupted`. Returns false if already interrupted or closed. Signal is automatically cleared on receipt.
- `close()` — blocks new sends, wakes all waiters with `.Closed`. Returns `(list.List, bool)` — remaining messages and whether this was the first close.

### Internal send pattern
```odin
list.push_back(&m.list, &msg.node)
m.len += 1
sync.cond_signal(&m.cond)
```

### Internal receive pattern
```odin
raw := list.pop_front(&m.list)
m.len -= 1
msg = container_of(raw, T, "node")
sync.cond_signal(&m.cond)   // wake next waiter if more messages remain
```

## `Loop_Mailbox($T)` — nbio loop mailbox

### Roles
- Sender: worker threads or client threads.
- Receiver: the nbio event loop thread only.

### Behavior
- Many threads can send.
- One receiver only — the nbio thread.
- The nbio thread never blocks inside the mailbox.
- It blocks only inside `nbio.tick()` or its wrappers like `nbio.run()` and `nbio.run_until()`.
- Synchronous OS calls like `nbio.open_sync()` also block.
- Every time a sender adds a message, it calls `nbio.wake_up` to interrupt the tick.

### API
- `send_to_loop(msg)` — adds message, calls `nbio.wake_up`.
- `try_receive_loop()` — returns one message. Never blocks. Call in a loop to drain.
- `close_loop()` — blocks new sends, calls `nbio.wake_up` once. Returns `(list.List, bool)` — remaining messages and whether this was the first close.
- `stats()` — message count. Not locked.

### Internal send pattern
```odin
list.push_back(&m.list, &msg.node)
m.len += 1
nbio.wake_up(m.loop)
```

## Key differences

| Feature | `Mailbox` | `Loop_Mailbox` |
|---|---|---|
| Thread type | Worker / client | nbio event loop |
| Wait method | `sync.cond_wait` | `nbio.tick` |
| Wake method | `sync.cond_signal` | `nbio.wake_up` |
| CPU when idle | zero | zero |
| Blocking receive | yes | no |

---

## Why two types?

- A blocking receive on the nbio thread would stop the event loop.
- `Loop_Mailbox` has no blocking receive. This prevents mistakes.
- Worker threads do not need `nbio.wake_up`. `Mailbox` is simpler for them.

---

## When to use which

- Use `Mailbox` for communication between worker threads.
- Use `Loop_Mailbox` to send commands to the nbio event loop.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Ownership
Once a message is sent, do not read or write to it. 
The mailbox owns the reference while it is queued. 
You only get ownership back when you `receive()` it or get it from `close()`.

### 2. Shutdown
1. Call `close()` to signal all threads to stop.
2. `close()` returns all undelivered messages. You own these again and can safely free them.
3. Wait for all threads to finish (`thread.join()`) before freeing the mailbox itself.

### 3. Threads
Always wait for all threads to finish (`thread.join`) before you free the mailbox itself.
The mailbox must stay alive as long as any thread can still access it.

### 4. Message lifetime
Never use stack-allocated messages for inter-thread communication.
The stack frame can be freed before the receiving thread reads the message.

Three ownership patterns:

1. **Heap**: `new` to allocate, `free` after receive. Simple. Good for low-frequency use.
2. **Pool**: `pool.get` / `pool.put`. Reuse messages. No new allocations during the run.
3. **MASTER**: one struct owns both pool and mailbox. One shutdown call handles everything.

"Zero copies" means mbox does not copy message data. It does not mean zero allocations.
You still allocate message objects. mbox just links them.

### 5. nbio loop initialization
On some platforms (like macOS/kqueue), `nbio.wake_up` requires that the event loop has been ticked at least once to register the internal wake-up event in the kernel. 

Before starting any threads that might call `send_to_loop` or `close_loop`, call `nbio.tick(0)` on the loop thread. This sets up the loop for signals.
