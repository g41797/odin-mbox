# Micro-System: Mini Print Server

**Discovery document — planning only. No code. No stage.**

---

## 1. Intent

The idioms in `design/idioms.md` exist because real protocols demand them. This document shows *why* each idiom is necessary by tracing it back to a concrete design conversation.

The starting point is the **tofu mantra** (`github.com/g41797/tofu`): a short dialog between two developers designing a message protocol for a Print Server. The mantra's claim:

> "Connect your developers. Then connect your applications."

Design the communication contract through conversation before writing code.

The same dialog applies directly to odin-itc. The two developers are designing the protocol between two odin-itc Masters. The messages they discuss are **items from pools**. The channels are **mboxes**. The Worker instances on R's side are **items in a thread pool**.

A reader of this document sees the design conversation first — then sees each idiom appear because the protocol demanded it.

---

## 2. The developer dialog (odin-itc version)

**Context:**

- Two developers are designing the message flow for a new Print Server.
- **S** is the Spool Server developer. S builds the Master that accepts print jobs and dispatches them.
- **R** is the Worker developer. R builds the Worker side that processes PDL data.
- Each "message" in the dialog is an **item from a pool**. Each "channel" is an **mbox**.

---

```
S: I don't know the addresses of the workers, so you should connect to me.
   Your Worker Master will send items to my forward mbox.

R: I'll get a HelloRequest item from my pool and send it. The item will carry
   a PDL-type field — either PS or PDF — so you know what I can process.

S: Do I need to send you a HelloResponse item?

R: No. Just start sending me job items on the forward mbox. I'll start
   processing as soon as I receive the first one.

S: The first item will carry a plain header — job ID and ticket type.
   The following items will carry PDL data. The PDL data can be large —
   it will be a string field inside the item.

R: Then those items are disposable. I'll get them from a disposable-item pool.
   The pool handles reset and dispose automatically via T_Hooks.

S: You forgot the Job Ticket.

R: Right. The first item should have a JobTicket field — JDF or PPD — and the
   ticket data as a string. The following items will have the PDL field with
   the content.

S: But JDF is usually used only for PDF...

R: Yes, but let's keep it flexible.

S: Can you process several jobs simultaneously?

R: It depends on licensing. Anyway, if I can, I'll borrow another Worker item
   from the thread pool. One job per Worker keeps things clean.

S: I need a progress signal.

R: No problem. I'll get a ProgressSignal item from my pool and send it back
   on the return mbox. The item will carry the job ID and the page range [N:M].

S: On job finish, send me a Response item with the job ID and processing status.

R: Why send an obsolete item? Are you expecting a graceful close?

S: Of course.

R: Then I'll send a ByeRequest item on the return mbox. The item will carry
   the same information. You'll send me a ByeResponse item on the forward mbox.
   After that my Worker Master will drain and exit.

S: That's enough for today. I'll save the item-type list in Git.

R: Deal. How about a cup of coffee?
```

## 3. Item type inventory

| Name | Plain / Disposable | Key fields | Direction | Pool owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HelloRequest` | Plain | `pdl_type: PDL_Type` | R → S (via forward mbox) | Worker Master |
| `JobTicket` | Disposable | `job_id: int`, `ticket_type: Ticket_Type`, `ticket_data: string` | S → R (via forward mbox) | Spool Master |
| `PDLChunk` | Disposable | `job_id: int`, `pdl_type: PDL_Type`, `content: string` | S → R (via forward mbox) | Spool Master |
| `ProgressSignal` | Plain | `job_id: int`, `page_from: int`, `page_to: int` | R → S (via return mbox) | Worker Master |
| `ByeRequest` | Plain | `job_id: int`, `status: Job_Status` | R → S (via return mbox) | Worker Master |
| `ByeResponse` | Plain | `job_id: int` | S → R (via forward mbox) | Spool Master |

**Notes:**

- `JobTicket` and `PDLChunk` carry a `string` field — dynamic heap resource. They require `dispose`, `reset`, and `factory` registered in `T_Hooks`. These are **disposable items**.
- All other items carry only value-type fields. `free` destroys them completely. These are **plain items**.
- `HelloRequest` travels in the initial handshake only. After that the forward mbox carries job items exclusively.

## 4. Mbox topology

```
Spool Master                        Worker Master
     │                                   │
     │  ←── HelloRequest ─────────────── │
     │                                   │
     │  ──── JobTicket ──────────────→   │
     │  ──── PDLChunk (×N) ──────────→  │
     │                                   │
     │  ←── ProgressSignal (×M) ──────── │
     │                                   │
     │  ←── ByeRequest ────────────────  │
     │  ──── ByeResponse ────────────→   │
     │                                   │
     ╔═══════════════╗         ╔═══════════════════╗
     ║  forward mbox ║         ║   return mbox     ║
     ║  S→R          ║         ║   R→S             ║
     ╚═══════════════╝         ╚═══════════════════╝
```

- **Forward mbox** (owned by Spool Master): carries `HelloRequest` (first), then `JobTicket`, `PDLChunk`, `ByeResponse`.
- **Return mbox** (owned by Worker Master): carries `ProgressSignal`, `ByeRequest`.
- Mboxes move **ownership**. Sender's `Maybe(^Itm)` inner becomes nil on successful send.

### Fan-Out

One sender, multiple receivers all reading from the same mbox.
Each item goes to whichever receiver calls `mbox.recv` first.
Result: natural load balancing across N workers.

```
[Spool Master] ──→ [mbox] ──→ [Worker A]
                         ──→ [Worker B]
                         ──→ [Worker C]
```

### Fan-In

Multiple senders, one receiver reading from one mbox.
Items from all senders arrive in arrival order.
Result: aggregation / merge point.

```
[RIP Master]          ──→ \
[Image Master]        ──→  [mbox] ──→ [Output Master]
[Color Profile Master]──→ /
```

No special framework code for either pattern. Just mbox + N Masters.

---

## 5. Internal architecture

### Spool Master

The Spool Master is the coordinator. It:

- Owns the **forward mbox** (receives from Workers; sends job items to Workers).
- Owns pools for `JobTicket`, `PDLChunk`, `ByeResponse` (plain).
- Holds a reference to the **Worker pool** (borrows and returns Worker Masters).
- On each new connection: borrows a Worker item from the thread pool, sends `HelloRequest`, then sends job items.
- On graceful close: receives `ByeRequest`, sends `ByeResponse`, returns Worker item to pool.
- Is heap-allocated. Threads hold `^SpoolMaster` safely.

### Worker side

The Worker side uses the **pool-of-threads** pattern:

```
Worker :: struct {
    thread:  ^thread.Thread,
    inbox:   mbox.Mbox,    // receives job items from Spool Master
    outbox:  mbox.Mbox,    // sends progress + bye back to Spool Master
}
WORKER_HOOKS :: pool.T_Hooks(Worker){
    factory = worker_factory,   // spawn thread, init mboxes
    dispose = worker_dispose,   // close mboxes, join thread, free
}
```

- The Spool Master owns the **Worker pool**.
- `pool_get` borrows a Worker (a running thread + its mboxes). `pool.put` returns it.
- Each Worker thread proc casts `rawptr` to `^Worker` and calls `worker_run`. It declares nothing on its own stack.
- `worker_factory` spawns the thread and initializes the mboxes. `worker_dispose` closes mboxes, joins the thread, frees the struct.
- Worker Master runs on the heap. No stack escapes.

---

## 6. Idiom mapping

Each design decision from the dialog maps to one or more idioms.

| Design decision | Idiom(s) |
|---|---|
| `JobTicket` and `PDLChunk` carry `string` fields | `disposable-itm`, `dispose-contract`, `t-hooks` |
| Send a disposable job item safely (cleanup if send fails) | `maybe-container`, `defer-dispose` |
| Return a job item to pool after receiving | `defer-put` |
| Spool Master borrows a Worker from the thread pool | `t-hooks` (factory = spawn thread, dispose = join + destroy) |
| Spool Master and Worker Master live on the heap | `heap-master` |
| Worker thread proc holds only `^Worker`, no ITC locals | `thread-container` |
| Worker factory fails halfway through init | `errdefer-dispose` |
| Shut down pools and mboxes on exit | `defer-destroy` |
| Graceful close driven by `ByeRequest` / `ByeResponse` items | `dispose-optional` (caller drives the shutdown item) |
| `pool.put` returns a foreign Worker pointer | `foreign-dispose` |
| `reset` clears job fields for reuse; `dispose` frees strings | `reset-vs-dispose` |
| Job item carries dynamic string fields (ticket, PDL) | `disposable-itm`, `t-hooks` |
| `pool.put` on job completion triggers `reset` hook as signal | `reset-vs-dispose` |
| N Worker Masters share one input mbox (Fan-Out) | `heap-master`, `thread-container` |
| Job carries logical route names; Master resolves at runtime | `disposable-itm` (route is dynamic) |
| `Sender($T)` wraps mbox behind a proc pointer | `t-hooks` style (proc-pointer-based behavioral abstraction) |

---

## 7. Confirmed parallel: tofu mantra → odin-itc

The tofu dialog defines a **protocol** — what flows between S and R — not the internal structure of either side.

| tofu concept | odin-itc concept |
|---|---|
| S (Spool Server developer) | designs the Spool Master |
| R (RIP Worker developer) | designs the Worker side |
| `HelloRequest` message | plain item from pool (PDL type field) |
| Job request with PDL data | disposable item from pool (PDL data = `string` field) |
| Progress signal | plain item from pool, sent back on return mbox |
| `ByeRequest` / `ByeResponse` | plain items from pool triggering graceful shutdown |
| "one job per channel" | one Worker Master per active connection |
| "another HelloRequest for a second job" | second Worker borrowed from the thread pool |
| Worker instance | item in a pool of Worker threads |
| Message channel S→R | mbox (forward) |
| Message channel R→S | mbox (return: progress + bye) |

---

## 8. What comes next

This document is the spec for a future implementation stage in `examples/`.

That stage will:

1. Define the item types (`JobTicket`, `PDLChunk`, `Job`, etc.) with `T_Hooks`.
2. Implement the Spool Master and Worker Master as heap-allocated structs.
3. Connect them with two mboxes.
4. Demonstrate the full lifecycle: connect → job → progress → bye → shutdown.
5. Show a pipeline: Spool Master → RIP Master → Output Master, each stage connected by a mbox.
6. Show Fan-Out: two Worker Masters sharing one input mbox.
7. Tag every idiom use with `// [itc: <tag>]`.

The implementation stage will be planned separately once this document is reviewed and approved.

---

## 9. Job as a first-class item

A `Job` is not just a data record. It is an item in the full odin-itc sense.

- Lives in a **Pool** (owned by a Master — e.g., the Spool Master or a Job Manager Master).
- Transferred between Masters via **Mboxes**. Ownership moves with the item.
- Returned to Pool after processing (`pool.put`). The **reset hook** can signal completion to the rest of the system.
- To start a new job: `pool_get` with timeout on the free-jobs pool. If the system is at capacity, the caller blocks.

The Job item is **disposable**. It carries string fields (ticket data, PDL content) that require `dispose`, `reset`, and `factory` in `T_Hooks`.

```
Job :: struct {
    job_id:      int,
    ticket_type: Ticket_Type,
    ticket_data: string,   // dynamic — needs dispose
    pdl_type:    PDL_Type,
    content:     string,   // dynamic — needs dispose
}
JOB_HOOKS :: pool.T_Hooks(Job){
    factory = job_factory,
    reset   = job_reset,    // clear fields; can signal completion
    dispose = job_dispose,  // delete(ticket_data); delete(content)
}
```

### Pool as capacity control

Pool size = max concurrent jobs. When the pool is empty, `pool_get` blocks the caller. This is **backpressure** with no extra code.

---

## 10. Pipeline and routing

Masters can be arranged as a pipeline:

```
[Spool Master] → mbox → [RIP Master] → mbox → [Image Master] → mbox → [Output Master]
```

Each stage receives a Job item from its input mbox, processes it, sends it to the next mbox.

### Pattern A — Job carries its own route

The Job item holds a list of logical names. Each Master reads the next name, resolves it to a real mbox, sends the Job there.

```
Job :: struct {
    ...
    route:        [dynamic]string,  // e.g. ["rip", "image", "output"]
    current_step: int,
}
```

Each Master advances `current_step` and looks up the next mbox by name in a **Registry**.

The Registry maps logical name → mbox pointer.
Masters register at startup. The Job route is resolved at runtime.

```
registry_get(name: string) -> ^mbox.Mbox
registry_set(name: string, m: ^mbox.Mbox)
```

**Why Registry, not Resolver:**
- "Resolver" is overloaded — DNS, Promises, DI containers all use it.
- "Registry" names both phases: `registry_set` at startup, `registry_get` at runtime.
- No conflict with odin-itc or Odin-lang concepts.

- Routing is visible in the Job.
- Changing the route means changing the Job data, not the Masters.

### Pattern B — Master sets the next destination

Each Master knows (via configuration or its own logic) which mbox to send to next. It sets a `next_mbox` field on the Job before sending.

- Routing logic lives in Masters.
- Job struct stays smaller.

Both patterns are valid. Use Pattern A when routes vary per job. Use Pattern B when routes are fixed by configuration.

---

## 11. Configuration-driven parallelism

The number of Masters (and thus threads) processing a stage is a configuration value:

```odin
stage_workers :: 4   // create 4 Masters, all sharing the same input mbox
```

Adding workers = changing a number. The mbox and item pools stay the same.

```
[Spool Master] → [mbox] → [RIP Worker 1]
                        → [RIP Worker 2]
                        → [RIP Worker 3]
                        → [RIP Worker 4]
```

All four Workers call `mbox.recv` on the same mbox. Items are distributed by arrival. No scheduler or coordinator needed.

### Summary table

| Concept | odin-itc realization |
|---|---|
| Unit of work | `Job` item in a pool |
| Work dispatch | `pool_get` → fill Job → `mbox_send` |
| Work completion | `pool.put` → reset hook notifies system |
| Pipeline stage | one Master + one input mbox |
| Parallelism | N Masters sharing one input mbox |
| Fan-Out / Fan-In | mbox natively |
| Routing | Job carries logical names (A) or Master sets next (B) |
| Capacity control | pool size = max concurrent jobs |
| Backpressure | `pool_get` blocks when pool is empty |

Pools, Mboxes, Items, and Masters compose into any topology: single worker, pipeline, fan-out, fan-in, dynamic routing — all from the same four primitives.

## 12. Sender — send-only abstraction

**What it is:**

A thin struct with a context pointer and a send proc. Same pattern as `WakeUper`.

```
Sender :: struct($T: typeid) {
    ctx:  rawptr,
    send: proc(ctx: rawptr, itm: Maybe(^T)) -> bool,
}
```

**Why it exists:**

A Master in a pipeline sends an item to the next stage.
It does not need to know if the receiver is a blocking `mbox.Mailbox` or a non-blocking `loop_mbox.Mbox`.
Only the send operation is common to both. `Sender($T)` captures exactly that.

**WakeUper analogy:**

| WakeUper | Sender($T) |
|---|---|
| Abstracts "wake something" | Abstracts "send to something" |
| `ctx: rawptr` | `ctx: rawptr` |
| `wake: proc(rawptr)` | `send: proc(rawptr, Maybe(^T)) -> bool` |
| `close: proc(rawptr)` | not needed — mbox owns its lifetime |
| Zero value = no-op | Zero value = no-op (nil send = discard) |

**Adapter constructors (requirements):**

- `mbox_sender(m: ^mbox.Mailbox($T)) -> Sender($T)`
  — wraps a blocking mailbox as a Sender.
- `loop_mbox_sender(m: ^loop_mbox.Mbox($T)) -> Sender($T)`
  — wraps an event-loop mbox as a Sender.
- Both return a value type. Caller owns the Sender.
- No heap allocation. The underlying mbox is not owned by Sender.

**Requirements:**

1. `Sender($T)` is a value type (copyable, like WakeUper).
2. Zero value is valid. `nil` send proc = discard item (no-op).
3. `mbox_sender` and `loop_mbox_sender` constructors live in their respective packages or in a thin adapter file.
4. `send` proc: takes `rawptr` (cast to concrete mbox type) and `Maybe(^T)`, returns `bool` (true = sent, false = mbox closed or nil).
5. Does not own or close the underlying mbox.
6. No allocations. No mutex. One proc call through the pointer.

**Where Sender is used:**

- Pattern A pipeline routing: Registry maps logical name → `Sender($T)`.
  `registry_get` returns `Sender($T)`, not `^mbox.Mbox`.
- Pattern B: Master stores `next: Sender($T)` set at init time.
- Both patterns benefit: Master code is the same regardless of mbox type behind the Sender.
