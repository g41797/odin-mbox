## Document Writing Rules

When editing this document, follow these rules:

**Sentences**
- One idea per line.
- Split compound sentences — do not chain clauses with commas.
- Do not pack a full explanation into one sentence.
- Use bullets or short sequential sentences instead.
- If you feel the urge to write "which", "that", or "because" mid-sentence — stop. Split.

**Language**
- Write for non-English developers.
- No academic words: "semantics", "structural", "contractual", "mechanism", "protocol".
- If you would not say it to a colleague at a whiteboard — rewrite it.

**Lists**
- Use bullet lists for sets of items, attributes, or steps.
- Use numbered lists only when order matters for correctness.

**Sequential steps**
- Write as a bullet list, not as a run-on sentence.
- Label the context: `Send side:` / `Receive side:` / `Algorithm:` etc.

**Tables**
- Use for result codes, mode behavior, and rules.
- Keep column count minimal — two or three columns maximum.

**Prose paragraphs**
- Reserve for motivation and explanation, not for API contracts.
- API contracts go in tables or bullet lists.

**Source files**
- Source files know nothing about layers — no layer references in comments or docs.
- No forward references to terms not yet defined in the document.
- Always use the two-value form to read the inner value of a `Maybe`: `ptr, ok := m.?`
- Never use the single-value form `ptr := m.?` — it panics if nil.
- Never cast or dereference around `.?`.

**Code snippets in documents**
- Every code snippet must come from an existing source file in this project.
- The source file must compile and pass tests.
- Files listed in `.gitignore` are not valid sources.
- Place a source tag immediately before each code fence:
  `<!-- snippet: <path>:<start_line>-<end_line> -->`
  Path is relative to `flat/`.
  Example: `<!-- snippet: examples/layer1/builder.odin:7-14 -->`
- When the source code changes, find all snippets referencing that file and update them.
  Search: `grep -r "snippet:.*<filename>" docs/`
- A snippet may be shortened with `// ...` to skip irrelevant lines.
  The tag still points to the full range.

**Cross-layer references**
- A layer may reference earlier layers.
- A layer must never reference later layers.
- Within a layer, do not mention concepts defined later in the same layer.

## Code Generation Rules

When generating or reviewing Odin code for this project, follow these rules:

**Status checks**
- Check the return value of every matryoshka API call (`mbox_send`, `mbox_wait_receive`, `pool_get`, `pool_get_wait`).
- Check the return value of every memory allocation (`new`, `make`).
- If the correct handling of a status is not obvious, add a comment: `// TODO(developer): handle <status> — <what could go wrong>`.
- Do not silently ignore a non-Ok status.

**Resource cleanup**
- Every allocated resource must be released — on success and on error.
- Use `defer` for cleanup that must happen on all exit paths.
- After `pool_get` succeeds, ensure `pool_put` is reachable on every path (including error paths).
- After `mbox_close`, drain the returned list. Do not discard it.
- After `pool_close`, drain and dispose the returned list.

**Maybe(^PolyNode)**
- Always use `ptr, ok := m.?` — never the single-value form.
- After a transfer (`mbox_send`, `pool_put`), do not use `m^` — it is nil.
- If `m^` is still non-nil after `pool_put`, the pool is closed. Dispose manually.

**Type aliases**
- When example or user code imports matryoshka, declare aliases for types used more than once and use them in code
- Each package declares aliases once in a shared file (e.g., `types.odin`).
- Example: `PolyNode :: matryoshka.PolyNode`
- Use the alias in all proc bodies. Keep `matryoshka.PolyNode` only in struct field definitions and imports.

## Work Tracking

For any iterative or long-running task, maintain a tracking entry below.
Each entry: task name, link to tracking file, current status, what's next.
When a task is complete, remove its entry.

This section is the resume point after `/clear` or a new session.

### Active tasks

**Advice catalog** — [advice_catalog.md](advice_catalog.md)
- Status: catalog created with all L1/L2/L3/generic advices and status table.
- Done: L1 advices partly in advices.md (explicit-alloc, defer-cleanup, unknown-id, builder-alloc, drain-list).
- Next: add remaining L1 advices to advices.md, create `flat/tests/advices/` with L1 tests.
- L2/L3 advices deferred until that code exists.
