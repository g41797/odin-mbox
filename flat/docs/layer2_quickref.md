# Layer 2 — Mailbox + Master — Quick Reference

> See [Deep Dive](layer2_deepdive.md) for patterns, diagrams, and code examples.
>
> **Prerequisite:** [Layer 1](layer1_quickref.md) (PolyNode, Maybe, Builder).

---

You get:
- Items that cross thread boundaries.
- A mailbox that moves ownership between Masters.
- A Master that ties it all together.

No pool yet.
Builder creates items.
Builder destroys items.
Mailbox moves them.

---

## Thread and Master

A thread is a thin container that runs exactly one Master.
You create the thread.
You pass the Master to it.
From here on, you think in Masters, not threads.

Master owns the pools and mailboxes that belong to its domain.
Master lives on the heap.
It is the unit of work in matryoshka.

```odin
// Thread proc
run :: proc(arg: rawptr) {
    m := (^Master)(arg)
    master_run(m)
}
```

---

## Mailbox — move items between Masters

Mailbox moves `^PolyNode` from one Master to another.
Does not know your types.
Blocking, with optional timeout.
Supports interrupt and close.

Mailbox holds ownership during transit.
It releases ownership to the receiver on success.

### Types

```odin
Mailbox :: distinct ^PolyNode

SendResult :: enum {
    Ok,
    Closed,
    Invalid,
}

RecvResult :: enum {
    Ok,
    Closed,
    Interrupted,
    Already_In_Use,
    Invalid,
    Timeout,
}

IntrResult :: enum {
    Ok,
    Closed,
    Already_Interrupted,
}
```

### New / Dispose

```odin
mbox_new           :: proc(alloc: mem.Allocator) -> Mailbox
matryoshka_dispose :: proc(m: ^Maybe(^PolyNode))
```

---

### send — blocking, ownership transfer

```odin
mbox_send :: proc(mb: Mailbox, m: ^Maybe(^PolyNode)) -> SendResult
```


Handover rules:

| Entry | Rule |
|-------|----------|
| `m == nil` | returns `.Invalid` |
| `m^ == nil` | returns `.Invalid` |
| `m^.id == 0` | returns `.Invalid` |
| `m^ != nil` | proceed |


Result:

| Result | `m^` after return |
|--------|------------------|
| `.Ok` | `nil` — enqueued, ownership transferred |
| `.Closed`, `.Invalid` | unchanged — caller still owns |

**Always check the return value.**
On non-Ok, the item is still yours.
Dispose or retry.

---

## wait_receive — blocking receive, with timeout

```odin
mbox_wait_receive :: proc(mb: Mailbox, out: ^Maybe(^PolyNode), timeout: time.Duration = -1) -> RecvResult
```

`timeout` values:
- `-1` — wait forever (default).
- `0` — non-blocking poll. Returns `.Timeout` immediately if empty.
- `> 0` — wait up to this duration. Returns `.Timeout` on expiry.

Entry contract:

| Entry | Contract |
|-------|----------|
| `out == nil` | returns `.Invalid` |
| `out^ != nil` | returns `.Already_In_Use` — refusing to overwrite |
| `out^ == nil` | proceed |

Result:

| Result | `out^` after return |
|--------|---------------------|
| `.Ok` | non-nil — dequeued, ownership transferred to caller |
| `.Closed`, `.Interrupted`, `.Timeout`, `.Invalid` | unchanged — caller owns nothing |

**Always check the return value.**
On non-Ok, `out^` is unchanged (nil).
Do not proceed.

---

## interrupt — wake without data

```odin
mbox_interrupt :: proc(mb: Mailbox) -> IntrResult
```

Wakes one Master waiting in `mbox_wait_receive`.
The receiver returns `.Interrupted`.

The interrupted flag is **self-clearing**:
- `mbox_wait_receive` clears it when it returns `.Interrupted`.
- A subsequent call to `mbox_wait_receive` will block normally.

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `.Ok` | flag set, waiter will wake |
| `.Closed` | mailbox is already closed — no effect |
| `.Already_Interrupted` | flag already set — no effect |

Not every signal carries data.
Interrupt says "go look".
Use a shared atomic or channel to communicate *what* changed.

---

## close — orderly shutdown

```odin
mbox_close :: proc(mb: Mailbox) -> list.List
```

- Marks mailbox as closed.
- Further `mbox_send` returns `.Closed`.
- Wakes all Masters waiting in `mbox_wait_receive` — they return `.Closed`.
- Returns all items still in the queue as a `list.List`.
- Returns an empty list if already closed — idempotent.

**Caller must drain the returned list.**

---

## try_receive_batch — non-blocking batch drain

```odin
try_receive_batch :: proc(mb: Mailbox) -> list.List
```

- Non-blocking — never waits.
- Returns all currently available items as `list.List`.
- Returns empty list on: nothing available, closed, interrupted, any error.
- If mailbox is in interrupted state: clears the flag before returning.
- Caller owns all items in the returned list.

**What the list contains:**

`list.List` is a chain of `^list.Node` — intrusive links, not `^Maybe(^PolyNode)`.
Each node is a `PolyNode`.
`PolyNode` embeds `list.Node` via `using` at offset 0.
Wrap each item in `Maybe` at the processing boundary.

---

## Master — runs on a thread, owns everything

Master is a user struct.
It runs on a thread.
It is the only participant that knows concrete types.

Master holds:
- Builder (from Layer 1).
- At least one Mailbox.
- Any other state it needs.

`newMaster` and `freeMaster` are always written together — they are a pair.

```odin
Master :: struct {
    builder: Builder,
    inbox:   Mailbox,
    alloc:   mem.Allocator,
    // ... other state ...
}
```

Every Master has at least one mailbox.
That is how other Masters talk to it.

```
┌─────────────┐
│  Master     │
│             ├──── inbox ◄════
│             │
└─────────────┘
```

## What you learned (Layer 2)

- Absence is also a state — timeout, interrupt.
- Not every signal carries data.
- Shutdown is part of normal flow.
- Think in Masters, not threads.
- Master sends Exit, not thread.join.
- Builder handles the lifecycle — no pool needed yet.
- You make mistakes.
- You send twice. You forget to clean up. You use wrong id.
- It fails. Not silently. You see it. You fix it.
- Master is yours. Your code, your logic. Matryoshka gives you Mailbox. Master is what you build on top.
